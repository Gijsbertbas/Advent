    "\n",
    "All units are very disciplined and always follow very strict combat rules. Units never move or attack diagonally, as doing so would be dishonorable. When multiple choices are equally valid, ties are broken in reading order: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right. For instance, the order in which units take their turns within a round is the reading order of their starting positions in that round, regardless of the type of unit or whether other units have moved after the round started. For example:\n",

    "Each unit begins its turn by identifying all possible targets (enemy units). If no targets remain, combat ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the unit identifies all of the open squares (.) that are in range of each target; these are the squares which are adjacent (immediately up, down, left, or right) to any target and which aren't already occupied by a wall or another unit. Alternatively, the unit might already be in range of a target. If the unit is not already in range of a target, and there are no open squares which are in range of a target, the unit ends its turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the unit is already in range of a target, it does not move, but continues its turn with an attack. Otherwise, since it is not in range of a target, it moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To move, the unit first considers the squares that are in range and determines which of those squares it could reach in the fewest steps. A step is a single movement to any adjacent (immediately up, down, left, or right) open (.) square. Units cannot move into walls or other units. The unit does this while considering the current positions of units and does not do any prediction about where units will be later. If the unit cannot reach (find an open path to) any of the squares that are in range, it ends its turn. If multiple squares are in range and tied for being reachable in the fewest steps, the step which is first in reading order is chosen. For example:\n",
